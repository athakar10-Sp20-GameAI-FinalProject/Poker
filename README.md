# Poker
Code by Matthew Barton & Arjun Thakar.

Done as the final project for Game AI (CSCI-3395-1 Spring 2020) with Dr. Britton Horn.

Implemented using Texas Hold'em rules and a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for the AI agent.

Card classes and enumerations were implemented using [this Stack Exchange question's design](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/10583/basic-poker-draw).
