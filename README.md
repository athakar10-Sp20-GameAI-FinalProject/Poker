# Poker
Code by Matthew Barton & Arjun Thakar.

Done as the final project for Game AI (CSCI-3395-1 Spring 2020) at Trinity University (TX) with Dr. Britton Horn.

Poker implemented using Texas (No Limit) Hold'em rules. AI agent implemented with a paralellized Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and some rule-based system behavior.

Deck/Card classes and some enumerations were implemented using [this Stack Exchange question's design](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/10583/basic-poker-draw).
